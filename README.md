# Lightning

Lightning is fast and efficient Javascript build system made for intermediate development. It skips timely processes, such as minify and uglify, and uses a minimal tag-based language to indicate dependencies. Lightning was created out of frustration with Javascript package managers and build systems, which are slow and a pain to debug.
